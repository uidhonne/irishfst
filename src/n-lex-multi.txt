! GENERAL NOTES
! 0.	Alphabet : a b c d e f g h i l m n o p r s t u + á é í ó ú.
!		 : j k q v w x y z originally were not used though some of them 
!		 : now exist in loan words (jíp=jeep, quinín=quinine, veilbhit=
!		 : velvet, xileafón=xylophone, zú=zoo)  
! 1.	There are three principal cases : Nominative, Genitive and Vocative
! 2.	Nouns are inflected for number, gender and case. They can be inflected at 
!	both start and the end of the word depending on whether the noun is:
!	- Masculine or Feminine
!	- has Broad (aouáóú)or Slender vowels (ieíé)
!	- has One syllable or More than one syllable
!	- has Long (áéíóú ao ae o[mh] u[mh] i[á|ó] u[á|ó] a[rd|rl|rn|rr]) 
!	  or Short vowels (aeiou) (this influences syncopation)
!	- is preceeded by an article or not (or posessive pronouns etc.)
! 2.1	Gender.
!	There are standard differences in the handling of nouns (in the singular) which 
!	start with a vowel, an "s" or another consonant, depending on whether they are
!	masculine or feminine.
!	- In the Nominative singular:
! 	After the definite article "an" 
!	(a) Feminine nouns will have "h" inserted after the initial consonant
!	    if possible - not all consonants are suitable. (^Sé Séimhiú)
!           In the case of an initial "s", a "t" will be placed before it 
!	    rather than "h" after it. (^ts)
!	    A word starting wil a vowel will be unchanged.
! 	(b) Masculine nouns will have "t-" inserted before an initial vowel.
!	    (^tv)
!	    All other words will be unchanged.
!	- In the Genitive Singular ....:
!		an/na etc...
!	- In the Vocative singular  ....
! 2.2	Vowel Harmony must be maintained within words ie a word must be Broad or Slender 
!	aouáóú are broad vowels; ieíé are slender vowels
! 3.	Number.
!	Nouns are traditionally divided into 5 grammatical classes called declensions,
!	which are based on the way in which the Genitive Singular is formed:
! 	1st. Declension - All Masculine - nouns all end in broad consonant
!		Gen. Sg : word end is made slender
!				  or -each/-ach is converted to -í/-aí
! 	2nd. Declension - All Feminine -  nouns end in broad or slender consonant
!		Gen. Sg : word end is made slender (if necessary) and an "e" is appended
!				  or -each/-ach is converted to -í/-aí
! 	3rd. Declension - Feminine & Masculine - nouns end in a broad or slender consonant.
!		Gen. Sg : word end is made broad (if necessary) and an "a" is appended
! 	4th. Declension - Feminine & Masculine - all end in a vowel or "ín"
!		Gen. Sg : no change
!	5th. Declension - Feminine & few Masc. - all end in -il, -in, -ir and -is? or a vowel
!		Gen. Sg : word ends in a broad consonant : Make broad if necessary
!				  and append "n" or "d" if root ends in a vowel.
!				  If the word has more than one syllable and the last 
!				  syllable is unstressed then the unstressed vowel is 
!				  removed (syncopation).
!
!	Plural:
!	Initial Mutations : Nominative plural - if vowel then prefix "h"
!		 Gen plural - if preceeded by article (na) then eclipse (prefix "urú")
!	
!	Final Mutations : 
!	Within each of the five declensions there are a variety of ways of performing
!	the inflections.
!	eg.	Add a syllable or letter to the base form, 
!		or change the vowels in the last syllable.
!		In a few cases there are also consonant changes. (^Ath Athru)
!
!
!	Note: I have maintained these five grammatical categories in this lexicon 
!	in order to  re-use information contained in dictionaries and grammar books 
!	and particularly dictionaries in electronic format.

^F	! whether the noun is masculine or feminine

^C 	! nominative, genitive & vocative : initial mutations of plural nouns 
^G 	! depend on the case
^V	!

^Sé	! Séimhiú (softening) Lenition - h added after certain initial
